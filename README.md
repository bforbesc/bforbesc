# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Forbes

Iâ€™m a data scientist, professor, and someone who has spent the last couple of years working on and teaching about data and AI. Iâ€™ve taught university students and executives alike, helping them stay close to both the tools and the theory.

Iâ€™m always open to discussions, collaborations, and learning opportunities. Let's connect and explore the world of data and AI together!
