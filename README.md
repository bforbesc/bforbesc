👨🏿‍💻 I am an Applied Economist (i.e. Data Scientist) working on natural experiments with digital platform data (Airbnb and Spotify), using traditional and machine learning methods. I am interested in computer science and technology at large.

👨🏿‍🏫 I am an Invited Teaching Assistant for Data Science graduate courses [(Master’s in Business Analytics)](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/programs/masters/business-analytics/program) at Nova SBE.

🏢 I am affiliated to the [Data Science Knowledge Center](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/data-science/people).

📃 If you are interested in data science you might find my repo [The Data Scientist Compendium](https://github.com/bforbesc/the-data-scientist-compendium) useful for your day-to-day tasks and ongoing learning.

🌐 I have also built a [clustering cross-sectional data web app](https://bforbesc-clustering-web-app-ml-web-app-ee5tk5.streamlit.app), which allows you to import your data and apply an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find and visualize your clusters, which you might find interesting.
