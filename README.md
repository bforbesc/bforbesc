📃 If you are interested in data science you might find my repo [The Data Scientist Compendium](https://github.com/bforbesc/the-data-scientist-compendium) useful for your day-to-day tasks and ongoing learning. Feel free to fork it and contribute to it!

🌐 I have also created a [web app](https://clustering-cross-sectional.herokuapp.com/) which allows you to do clustering on cross-sectional data, which you might find interesting. [The repo](https://github.com/bforbesc/clustering-web-app) is publicly available for you to play with.
