üìÉ If you are interested in data science you might find my repo [The Data Scientist Compendium](https://github.com/bforbesc/the-data-scientist-compendium) useful for your day-to-day tasks and ongoing learning.

üåê I have also built a [clustering cross-sectional data web app](https://bforbesc-clustering-web-app-ml-web-app-ee5tk5.streamlit.app), which allows you to import your data and apply an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find and visualize your clusters, which you might find interesting.
