# 👋 Hi, I'm Forbes

I’m a data scientist, professor, and someone who has spent the last couple of years working on and teaching about data and AI. I’ve taught university students and executives alike, helping them stay close to both the tools and the theory.

I’m always open to discussions, collaborations, and learning opportunities. Let's connect and explore the world of data and AI together!
